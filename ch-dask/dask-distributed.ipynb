    "# Scaling Dask to a Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "The computations we've discussed so far are performed on a single machine. `dask.distributed` allows us to extend Dask computations to multiple computing nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dask Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted in {numref}`dask-distributed-img`, a Dask cluster must include a scheduler and multiple workers. Users submit computational tasks to the scheduler on a client, and the scheduler analyzes the tasks, generates a Task Graph, and distributes tasks to multiple workers. Each worker is responsible for a small portion of the tasks, and communication between workers is essential for tasks such as aggregating computation results.\n",

    "\n",
    "By default (without any additional settings), Dask initiates a [`LocalCluster`](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/api.html#distributed.LocalCluster) and connects to it using the [`Client`](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/api.html#client)."

    "## Auto-Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, Kubernetes and HPC clusters support Auto-Scaling (or Adaptive Scaling). Kubernetes and Slurm are resource management software. They manage a large number of computing resources, and different applications request resources from them. Dask clusters built on Kubernetes or Slurm request a subset of the computing resources managed by Kubernetes or Slurm. On Kubernetes or Slurm clusters, Dask's auto-scaling technology can be utilized to automatically increase or decrease the required computing resources. Auto-scaling considers the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The current job demands high computing resources, requiring more resources to meet computational needs.\n",
    "* The current job's requested computing resources are idle and can be used by other users, especially when users are engaging in interactive data visualization rather than large-scale computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `KubeCluster` and `SLURMCluster` provide an `adapt()` method. The following example dynamically scales between 0 and 10 workers. Auto-scaling decides how many Dask Workers to run based on the load on the Dask Scheduler. Dask collects information such as used and available memory on each Dask Worker and adjusts the number of computing resources adaptively.\n",

    "When Dask clusters are launched, in addition to starting the Dask Scheduler and Dask Worker, a monitoring service called Dask Nanny is also initiated. Just like its name, Dask Nanny monitors the CPU and memory usage of Dask Workers to prevent them from exceeding resource limits. If a Dask Worker crashes, Dask Nanny restarts it. If a Dask Worker is restarted by Dask Nanny, the computation tasks on that worker are re-executed. Other Dask Workers hold on the data and wait for this worker to recover. This can significantly burden other Dask Workers. If Dask workers are frequently restarting, you should consider adjusting the data size of each partition using `rechunk()` or `repartition()`."
