    "# Xinference\n",
    "\n",
    "Xorbits Inference (Xinference) is an inference platform for large models, supporting large language models, vector models, and text-to-image models. It is based on the distributed computation provided by [Xoscar](https://github.com/xorbitsai/xoscar), allowing models to be deployed on a cluster. The platform offers an OpenAI-like interface, enabling users to deploy and call open-source large models. Xinference integrates the API for external services, inference engine, and hardware, eliminating the need to write code to manage model inference services like Ray Serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inference Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Xinference can adapt to different inference engines, including Hugging Face Transformers, [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), etc. Therefore, you need to install the corresponding inference engine during installation, such as `pip install \"xinference[transformers]\"`. Transformers is entirely based on PyTorch, offering the fastest and most comprehensive model compatibility, but with poorer performance; other inference engines, such as vLLM and llama.cpp, focus on performance optimization but do not cover as many models as Transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using, you need to start a Xinference cluster, which can be either single-machine multi-GPU or multi-machine multi-GPU. On a single machine, you can start it from the command line like this:"

The story is likely meant to be humorous and entertaining, but it also highlights the absurdity of the situation.\n",

Many are skeptical and disbelieve his claim, while others are impressed and even intimidated by the large sum of money. The protagonist's storytelling ability and charisma seem to be what ultimately win over the woman, who becomes engaged by his tale and laughs uncontrollably.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of what motivates the two brothers to make their bet, it seems that boredom and social beliefs play a role. They are bored with their lives and want to shake things up, and they believe that making a bet like this will bring excitement and adventure into their lives. Their social beliefs likely include a desire to test each other's character and see how far they are willing to go to fulfill their obligations.\n",

      "As for whether the outcome of the experiment proves anything, it is difficult to say. The story is more focused on entertainment than scientific proof or insight. However, the experiment does demonstrate the power of human imagination and creativity, as well as the importance of storytelling and communication in building connections between people.\n",

      "If I were to rewrite \"The Million Pound Bank-Note\" in today's society, I might update the premise to involve something like a digital currency or cryptocurrency. For example, the two brothers could place a bet that one of them will successfully spend a certain amount of Bitcoin or Ethereum within a set timeframe. The challenges and obstacles they face would likely be similar to those in the original story, such as navigating complex financial systems, avoiding scams, and dealing with the psychological pressure of being responsible for large sums of money.\n",

      "Elements that would remain the same in a modern retelling of the story include the themes of boredom, social beliefs, and the power of storytelling. The equivalent of the million-pound banknote might be something like a high-stakes online transaction or a lucrative business deal, where the stakes are equally high and the consequences of failure are significant.\n",
